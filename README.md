# LumbarDegeneration

About This Notebook
Hi! I created this notebook to work on the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification task using PyTorch and pretrained models like ResNet. 
This is a step-by-step guide where I preprocess the data, train a model, and make predictions for submission. It’s meant to help anyone interested in experimenting with deep learning techniques for medical imaging.

Contents of the Notebook
Introduction
A quick overview of the RSNA competition and the approach I took.

Setup

Importing necessary libraries (PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, etc.).
Configuring the environment for smooth execution.
Data Preprocessing

Loading the train.csv file and handling missing values.
Organizing image paths and extracting metadata from DICOM files.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing data distributions.
Exploring labels and data mapping to understand the dataset better.
Model Development

Using a pretrained ResNet model for classification.
Fine-tuning the model to fit the specific conditions of the task.
Training

Defining a custom dataloader and training loop.
Running the training process on GPU (if available).
Inference and Submission

Generating predictions on the test dataset.
Preparing the submission.csv file for the competition.
Key Features
Pretrained ResNet: Leveraging a powerful pretrained model for quick and efficient training.
Custom Data Processing: Includes handling of DICOM files and metadata.
Submission-Ready Workflow: Everything is structured to create a Kaggle-compatible submission.
Requirements
To run this notebook, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x
Libraries:
PyTorch
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
pydicom (for working with medical images)
Install these libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset:
"\n"
You’ll need the RSNA 2024 competition dataset. Place the train.csv file and image directories in the required paths mentioned in the notebook.

How to Use This Notebook
Download this notebook and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Install the required libraries (see the Requirements section).
Place the RSNA dataset in the appropriate directories.
Run the cells step-by-step to process the data, train the model, and generate predictions.

Future Work
I plan to:

Try other architectures like ConvNeXt or Vision Transformers.
Experiment with more data augmentation techniques to boost model performance.
Add detailed error analysis and better visualizations of model predictions.
Feedback and Contributions
If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to share! I’m open to collaborating on this project and learning from others.
